# Sales Prediction Project


## Overview
This project aims to predict sales using machine learning models. It was part of a Kaggle competition where the objective was to train the best model to predict sales from given data. The model with the highest R¬≤ score on the test data was considered the best.

## Project Description
Welcome to our Sales Prediction Project, where we ventured into the wild world of machine learning for the very first time! Yes, this was our debut into the thrilling realm of predictive modeling and competitions.

As good data scientists (or aspiring ones), our journey began with a literature review on sales forecasting methods. We wanted to ensure we weren't reinventing the wheel‚Äîor worse, inventing a square wheel. We delved into various papers and articles to get a grasp on the best techniques and practices to apply to our project.


## Methodology
1. **Literature Review**: Reviewed relevant papers and articles on sales forecasting to identify effective techniques and models.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and performed feature engineering.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the data to understand patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.
4. **Model Training**: Trained various machine learning models, including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
5. **Model Selection**: Selected the best-performing model based on the R¬≤ score.
6. **Prediction**: Used the best model to make predictions on the REAL_DATA.csv.

## Results
Drumroll, please... ü•Å Our best model achieved an R¬≤ score of 0.96 on the test set, indicating a strong predictive performance. And the cherry on top? This model won the competition! üéâ
